## Zero-Coupon Bond:
A bond that is issued at a discount to its face value and does not pay periodic interest. Instead, it matures at its face value, and the difference between the purchase price and face value represents the interest income. Day traders may encounter zero-coupon bonds in the context of interest rate speculation.
